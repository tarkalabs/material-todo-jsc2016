This is a todo MVC example based on [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/), [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) and [immstruct](https://github.com/omniscientjs/immstruct).

To run this example, first do a `npm install` and then run `npm run development`.

The example is based of the boilerplate [React Universally](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally).
